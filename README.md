# Lead Score Prediction

This is a team project consisting of <Lakshita><Angel> and myself. The project is implemented using R programming language. Lead Score Prediction is a rather hot topic in many fields especially in the field of Sales and Marketing. Lead scores are used in order to improve sales, improvise strategies of marketing and so on. Starting at the very basics, a lead is a potential client. When a user is browsing on the web for something, a related advertisement is most likely to pop up. Out of either curiosity or sheer happenstance, the user clicks on this advertisement. Once the user has clicked on the advertisement, they look at the contents of the page. If they are even moderately interested, they enter basic details such as name, phone number and/or email ID. They now become a lead – a potential customer – to that particular service or product. Another way that leads are generated is when users intentionally search for a website and then enter their details. Leads can also be generated from past referrals.
Once a lead is gained, it is the role of the company to follow up on these leads in order to convert them from being a potential client into a client. There are various ways in which this is done. The company can make calls, emails and even place more advertisements to the lead. One must keep in mind that all of this bear costs. If blind and naïve efforts are taken in order to convert a lead into a client, sometimes it may lead to loss for the company. This is because not all leads are converted to clients. One of the ways in which loss can be prevented is to make efforts only to targeted leads. In this way, efforts are streamlined to fewer leads with a greater conversion rate.
The targeted clients are the ones with a higher lead score. Lead score in turn is the score assigned to each lead on the basis of various factors and their behaviour in relation to their interest levels in the services or products offered. These factors and behaviours are predetermined by the company in order to assess the lead scores. Generally, the lead score ranges from zero to hundred, both inclusive. Lower scored leads are termed as ‘cold leads’ while higher scored leads are termed as ‘hot leads’.
The data collected for the purpose of this project is of a sample company called ‘X Education’. This company is basically a marketplace for courses targeted at industrial professionals. The company markets its courses on various search engines and social media platforms. The current conversion rate of X Education is thirty percent. This means that of all the leads gained, only thirty percent of them are getting converted into clients, in turn meaning that seventy percent of the leads were not converted to clients. One can see the proportion of wasted efforts in this situation. If the company continues with these numbers, it could be deleterious to the financial state of the company. The aim of this project is to identify target hot leads and thereby increase the conversion rate of the company while streamlining their efforts.
